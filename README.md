CS171 Final Project
The final project of CS171 will live here.

TO DO's
Here are some of the things we need to do moving forward:

Enhance Interaction with Line Plots: While the first three visualizations are connected to clicking on a logo, hovering over a line in the line plots does not yet highlight the other 
visualizations. This interactivity needs to be implemented.

Dynamic Play Visualization: The 'play vis' is currently static. We need to implement interaction to start a given play and animate the dots. These plays should be particularly interesting or 
significant, like plays with fumbles or where defensive linemen tackle the QB.

Expand Statistical Display: With the extensive data available, we can display more statistics, such as those for every QB. Consider adding another visualization to showcase QB statistics.

Database Consideration for Play Data: Given the vast number of plays across numerous games and teams, it might be more efficient to store this data in a database. This approach needs further 
exploration to determine its feasibility and implementation.
